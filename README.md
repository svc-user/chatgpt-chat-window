# chatgpt-chat-window
This project is a simple and direct application built with Delphi, an object-oriented, visual programming environment to develop applications. The primary purpose of `chatgpt-chat-window` is to build a more streamlined and interactive platform where induced prompts and responses can be visualized better. This application is integrated with `gpt-3.5-turbo/gpt-4`, one of the most advanced language models developed by OpenAI.

## Features
The distinctive features of `chatgpt-chat-window` include:

### Streaming Response
This feature ensures real-time interaction, providing users with a smoother and more engaging experience. It enables the application to handle multiple events or requests concurrently without causing any delay or performance glitch. 

### GPT-3.5 Turbo / GPT-4 options
The application gets its language modeling capabilities by leveraging the GPT, i.e., Generative Pretrained Transformers, developed by OpenAI. With options including `gpt-3.5-turbo` and the upcoming `gpt-4`, users can tune these according to their needs for an advanced and enhanced experience.

### Save / Restore Conversations
One of our system's key capabilities includes the ability to save conversations while the user is interacting with the system. Users can also restore these conversations later. This functionality will help maintain context even when the chat session is dispersed over different time frames or sessions.

### Set System Prompts
To provide an intuitive and responsive user experience, users have the option to set system prompts as per their requirement. This makes the conversations more interactive and engaging, enabling users to convey complex ideas with ease.
